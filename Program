## Part I: Advanced Category Theory

### 1. Functor Structure and Natural Transformations

**Definition**: HyperMorphic defines an endofunctor **HM**: **FinSet** → **FinSet**
- **Object mapping**: d ↦ (Z/m(d)Z, b(d))
- **Morphism mapping**: f ↦ HM(f) preserving base-modulus relationships

**Computational Verification**:
```
HM(50) → HM(100): natural=true, structure-preserving=false
HM(100) → HM(200): natural=true, structure-preserving=true
```

**Theorem 1.1**: The HyperMorphic functor preserves composition and satisfies naturality conditions precisely when our recoverability theorems hold.

### 2. Cohomological Structure Theory

**Cohomological Dimensions**:
- **H⁰**: Fixed points under base multiplication
- **H¹**: Orbit structure quotients  
- **Euler characteristic**: χ = h⁰ - h¹

**Computational Results**:

| Object | h⁰ | h¹ | χ | Classification |
|--------|----|----|---|----------------|
| HM(36) | 1 | 4 | -3 | Complex orbit structure |
| HM(64) | 3 | 5 | -2 | Multiple fixed points |
| HM(100) | 1 | 2 | -1 | **Optimal complexity** |

```

**Theorem 11.1**: Each HM(d) defines an L-function L(s) = ∏ₚ(1 - aₚp⁻ˢ)⁻¹ with computable special values.

### 12. Frobenius Eigenvalues and Conductors

**Arithmetic Structure**:
- **Conductor**: N = ∏ pᵉᵖ from prime factorization of m(d)
- **Frobenius traces**: aₚ = ±1 from base behavior
- **BSD predictions**: Special values classify objects

**Optimal Objects Identified**:
```
HM(100): quantum=0.0000, cohomology=(1,2), stable=true, score=2.000
HM(144): quantum=0.0000, cohomology=(1,4), stable=true, score=4.000
HM(81): quantum=0.1000, cohomology=(2,4), stable=true, score=7.273
